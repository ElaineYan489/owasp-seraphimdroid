    "text": "Open WiFi can be nice feature of many public spaces. However open WiFi is insecure, since other users of the network may route traffic through their device and monitor the traffic. By doing that they will be able to steal sessions and perform man in the middle attacks. All accounts mobile device is bound to (Facebook, Twitter, mobile banking, email) can be compromised. In order to overcome this, user should either not use open WiFi networks or use together with VPN (Virtual Private Network). VPN will encrypt traffic, making it hard or impossible to steal sessions or perform man in the middle attack.",

This habit is however dangerous for the fact that the task is left to the host system and every related operations are ignored by the user. This element constitutes a vulnerability and therefore an open door for attackers. On Android, for instance, if default, the “automatic updates” option is selected, then the new version of the updated application could acquire new permissions in background without any knowledge of the user. These permissions are declared consciously in the new version by the attacker to gain the control of the system. The user must not select this option by default and must control the update operations carefully.",
